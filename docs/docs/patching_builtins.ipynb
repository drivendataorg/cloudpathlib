    "# Patching Python builtins (third-party library compatibility)\n",
    "\n",
    "Not every Python library is implemented to accept pathlib-compatible objects like those implemented by cloudpathlib. Many libraries will only accept strings as filepaths. These libraries then may internally use `open`, functions from `os` and `os.path`, or other core library modules like `glob` to navigate paths and manipulate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that out-of-the-box you can't just pass a `CloudPath` object to any method of function and have it work. For those implemented with `pathlib`, this will work. For anything else the code will throw an exception at some point.\n",
    "\n",
    "The long-term solution is to ask developers to implement their library to support either (1) pathlib-compatible objects for files and directories, or (2) file-like objects passed directly (e.g., so you could call `CloudPath.open` in your code and pass the the file-like object to the library).\n",
    "\n",
    "The short-term workaround that will be compatible with some libraries is to patch the builtins to make `open`, `os`, `os.path`, and `glob` work with `CloudPath` objects. Because this overrides default Python functionality, this is not on by default. When patched, these functions will use the `CloudPath` version if they are passed a `CloudPath` and will fallback to their normal implementations otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods can be enabled by setting the following environment variables:\n",
    " - `CLOUDPATHLIB_PACTH_ALL=1` - patch all the builtins we implement: `open`, `os` functions, and `glob`\n",
    " - `CLOUDPATHLIB_PACTH_OPEN=1` - patch the builtin `open` method\n",
    " - `CLOUDPATHLIB_PACTH_OS_FUNCTIONS=1` - patch the `os` functions\n",
    " - `CLOUDPATHLIB_PACTH_GLOB=1` - patch the `glob` module\n",
    "\n",
    "You can set environment variables in many ways, but it is common to either pass it at the command line with something like `CLOUDPATHLIB_PACTH_ALL=1 python my_script.py` or to set it in your Python script with `os.environ['CLOUDPATHLIB_PACTH_ALL'] = 1`. Note, these _must_ be set before any `cloudpathlib` methods are imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can call methods to patch the functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from cloudpathlib import patch_open, patch_os_functions, patch_glob\n",
    "\n",
    "# patch builtins\n",
