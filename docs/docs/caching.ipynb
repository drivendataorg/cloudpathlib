    "## Are we synced?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before `cloudpathlib`, we spent a lot of time syncing our remote and local files. There was no great solution. For example, I just need one file, but I only have a script that downloads the entire 800GB bucket (or worse, you can't remember exactly _which_ files you need ðŸ¤®). Or _even worse_, you have all the files synced to your local machine, but you suspect that some are are up-to-date and some are stale. More often that I'd like to admit, the simplest answer was to blast the whole data directory and download all over again. Bandwidth doesn't grow on trees!\n",

    "## Cache me if you can\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of what makes `cloudpathlib` so useful is that it takes care of all of that, leaving your precious mental resources free to do other things! It maintains a local cache and only downloads a file if the local version and remote versions are out of sync. Every time you read or write a file, `cloudpathlib` goes through these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does the file exist in the cache already?\n",
    "- If no, download it to the cache.\n",
    "- If yes, does the cached version have the same modtime as the cloud version?\n",
    "- If it is older, re-download the file and replace the old cached version with the updated version.\n",
    "- If it is newer, something is upâ€•you shouldn't be messing with the cache! Warn the user that the cached version is newer and offer some options to resolve the versions.-"
