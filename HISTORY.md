# History

## v0.2.1 (2020-01-25)

- Fixed bug where a NameError was raised if the Google Stroage dependencies were not installed (even if using a different storage provider).


## v0.2.0 (2020-01-23)

- Added support for Google Cloud Storage. Instantiate with URIs prefixed by `gs://` or explicitly using the `GSPath` class. ([#113](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/113) thanks to [@wolfgangwazzlestrauss](https://github.com/wolfgangwazzlestrauss))
- Changed backend logic to reduce number of network calls to cloud. This should result in faster cloud path operations, especially when dealing with many small files. ([#110](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/issues/110), [#111](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/111))

## v0.1.2 (2020-11-14)

- Fixed `CloudPath` instantiation so that reinstantiating with an existing `CloudPath` instance will reuse the same client, if a new client is not explicitly passed. This addresses the edge case of non-idempotency when reinstantiating a `CloudPath` instance with a non-default client. ([#104](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/104))

## v0.1.1 (2020-10-15)

- Fixed a character-encoding bug when building from source on Windows. ([#98](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/98))

## v0.1.0 (2020-10-06)

- Initial release of cloudpathlib with support for Amazon S3 and Azure Blob Storage! ðŸŽ‰
