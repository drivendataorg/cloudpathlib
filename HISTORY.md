# cloudpathlib Changelog

## Unreleased

- Fixed `CloudPath(...) / other` to correctly attempt to fall back on `other`'s `__rtruediv__` implementation, in order to support classes that explicitly support the `/` with a `CloudPath` instance. Previously, this would always raise a `TypeError` if `other` were not a `str` or `PurePosixPath`. (PR [#479](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/479))

## v0.20.0 (2024-10-18)

- Added support for custom schemes in CloudPath and Client subclases. (Issue [#466](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/issues/466), PR [#467](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/467))
- Fixed `ResourceNotFoundError` on Azure gen2 storage accounts with HNS enabled and issue that some Azure credentials do not have `account_name`. (Issue [#470](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/issues/470), Issue [#476](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/issues/476), PR [#478](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/478))
- Added support for Python 3.13 (Issue [#472](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/issues/472), [PR #474](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/474)):

  - [`follow_symlinks` kwarg added to `is_dir`](https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.is_dir) added as no-op
  - [`newline` kwarg added to `read_text`](https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.read_text)
  - [`recurse_symlinks` kwarg added to `glob`](https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.glob) added as no-op

  - [`recurse_symlinks` kwarg added to `rglob`](https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.rglob) added as no-op
  - [`pattern` parameter for `rglob` can be PathLike](https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.rglob)
  - [`.parser` property added](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.PurePath.parser)


## v0.19.0 (2024-08-29)

- Fixed an error that occurred when loading and dumping `CloudPath` objects using pickle multiple times. (Issue [#450](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/issues/450), PR [#454](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/454), thanks to [@kujenga](https://github.com/kujenga))
- Fixed typo in `FileCacheMode` where values were being filled by environment variable `CLOUPATHLIB_FILE_CACHE_MODE` instead of `CLOUDPATHLIB_FILE_CACHE_MODE`. (PR [#424](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/424), thanks to [@mynameisfiber](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/424))
- Fixed `CloudPath` cleanup via `CloudPath.__del__` when `Client` encounters an exception during initialization and does not create a `file_cache_mode` attribute. (Issue [#372](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/issues/372), thanks to [@bryanwweber](https://github.com/bryanwweber))
- Removed support for Python 3.7 and pinned minimal `boto3` version to Python 3.8+ versions. (PR [#407](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/407))
- Changed `GSClient` to use the native `exists()` method from the Google Cloud Storage SDK. (PR [#420](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/420), thanks to [@bachya](https://github.com/bachya))
- Changed default clients to be lazily instantiated (Issue [#428](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/issues/428), PR [#432](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/issues/432))
- Fixed `download_to` to check for the existence of the cloud file (Issue [#430](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/issues/430), PR [#433](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/433))
- Added env vars `CLOUDPATHLIB_FORCE_OVERWRITE_FROM_CLOUD` and `CLOUDPATHLIB_FORCE_OVERWRITE_TO_CLOUD`. (Issue [#393](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/issues/393), PR [#437](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/437))
- Fixed `glob` for `cloudpathlib.local.LocalPath` and subclass implementations to match behavior of cloud versions for parity in testing. (Issue [#415](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/issues/415), PR [#436](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/436))
- Changed how `cloudpathlib.local.LocalClient` and subclass implementations track the default local storage directory (used to simulate the cloud) used when no local storage directory is explicitly provided. (PR [#436](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/436), PR [#462](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/462))
    - Changed `LocalClient` so that client instances using the default storage access the default local storage directory through the `get_default_storage_dir` rather than having an explicit reference to the path set at instantiation. This means that calling `get_default_storage_dir` will reset the local storage for all clients using the default local storage, whether the client has already been instantiated or is instantiated after resetting. This fixes unintuitive behavior where `reset_local_storage` did not reset local storage when using the default client. (Issue [#414](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/issues/414))
    - Added a new `local_storage_dir` property to `LocalClient`. This will return the current local storage directory used by that client instance.
    by reference through the `get_default_ rather than with an explicit.
- Refined the return type annotations for `CloudPath.open()` to match the behavior of `pathlib.Path.open()`. The method now returns specific types (`TextIOWrapper`, `FileIO`, `BufferedRandom`, `BufferedWriter`, `BufferedReader`, `BinaryIO`, `IO[Any]`) based on the provided `mode`, `buffering`, and `encoding` arguments. ([Issue #465](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/issues/465), [PR #464](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/464))
- Added Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 support (Issue [#161](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/issues/161), PR [#450](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/450)), thanks to [@M0dEx](https://github.com/M0dEx) for PR [#447](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/447) and PR [#449](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/449)

## v0.18.1 (2024-02-26)

## v0.6.0 (2021-09-07)

- Added `no_sign_request` parameter to `S3Client` instantiation for anonymous requests for public resources on S3. See [documentation](https://cloudpathlib.drivendata.org/stable/api-reference/s3client/#cloudpathlib.s3.s3client.S3Client.__init__) for more details. ([#164](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/164))

## v0.5.0 (2021-08-31)

- Added `boto3_transfer_config` parameter to `S3Client` instantiation, which allows passing a `boto3.s3.transfer.TransferConfig` object and is useful for controlling multipart and thread use in uploads and downloads. See [documentation](https://cloudpathlib.drivendata.org/stable/api-reference/s3client/#cloudpathlib.s3.s3client.S3Client.__init__) for more details. ([#150](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/150))

- Added support for custom S3-compatible object stores. This functionality is available via the `endpoint_url` keyword argument when instantiating an `S3Client` instance. See [documentation](https://cloudpathlib.drivendata.org/stable/authentication/#accessing-custom-s3-compatible-object-stores) for more details. ([#138](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/138) thanks to [@YevheniiSemendiak](https://github.com/YevheniiSemendiak))

  - `CloudPath.copy` copy a file from one location to another. Can be cloud -> local or cloud -> cloud. If `client` is not the same, the file transits through the local machine.
  - `CloudPath.copytree` reucrsively copy a directory from one location to another. Can be cloud -> local or cloud -> cloud. Uses `CloudPath.copy` so if `client` is not the same, the file transits through the local machine.

## v0.4.0 (2021-03-13)

- Added rich comparison operator support to cloud paths, which means you can now use them with `sorted`. ([#129](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/129))
- Added polymorphic class `AnyPath` which creates a cloud path or `pathlib.Path` instance appropriately for an input filepath. See new [documentation](https://cloudpathlib.drivendata.org/stable/anypath-polymorphism/) for details and example usage. ([#130](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/130))
- Added integration with [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/). See new [documentation](https://cloudpathlib.drivendata.org/stable/integrations/#pydantic) for details and example usage. ([#130](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/130))
- Exceptions: ([#131](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/131))
    - Changed all custom `cloudpathlib` exceptions to be located in new `cloudpathlib.exceptions` module.
    - Changed all custom `cloudpathlib` exceptions to subclass from new base `CloudPathException`. This allows for easy catching of any custom exception from `cloudpathlib`.
    - Changed all custom exceptions names to end with `Error` as recommended by [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#exception-names).
    - Changed various functions to throw new `CloudPathFileExistsError`, `CloudPathIsADirectoryError` or `CloudPathNotADirectoryError` exceptions instead of a generic `ValueError`.
    - Removed exception exports from the root `cloudpathlib` package namespace. Import from `cloudpathlib.exceptions` instead if needed.
- Fixed `download_to` method to handle case when source is a file and destination is a directory. ([#121](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/121) thanks to [@genziano](https://github.com/genziano))
- Fixed bug where `hash(...)` of a cloud path was not consistent with the equality operator. ([#129](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/129))
- Fixed `AzureBlobClient` instantiation to throw new error `MissingCredentialsError` when no credentials are provided, instead of `AttributeError`. `LocalAzureBlobClient` has also been changed to accordingly error under those conditions. ([#131](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/131))
- Fixed `GSClient` to instantiate as anonymous with public access only when instantiated with no credentials, instead of erroring. ([#131](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/131))

## v0.3.0 (2021-01-29)

- Added a new module `cloudpathlib.local` with utilities for mocking cloud paths in tests. The module has "Local" substitute classes that use the local filesystem in place of cloud storage. See the new documentation article ["Testing code that uses cloudpathlib"](https://cloudpathlib.drivendata.org/stable/testing_mocked_cloudpathlib/) to learn more about how to use them. ([#107](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/107))

## v0.2.1 (2021-01-25)

- Fixed bug where a `NameError` was raised if the Google Cloud Storage dependencies were not installed (even if using a different storage provider).

## v0.2.0 (2021-01-23)

- Added support for Google Cloud Storage. Instantiate with URIs prefixed by `gs://` or explicitly using the `GSPath` class. ([#113](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/113) thanks to [@wolfgangwazzlestrauss](https://github.com/wolfgangwazzlestrauss))
- Changed backend logic to reduce number of network calls to cloud. This should result in faster cloud path operations, especially when dealing with many small files. ([#110](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/issues/110), [#111](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/111))

## v0.1.2 (2020-11-14)

- Fixed `CloudPath` instantiation so that reinstantiating with an existing `CloudPath` instance will reuse the same client, if a new client is not explicitly passed. This addresses the edge case of non-idempotency when reinstantiating a `CloudPath` instance with a non-default client. ([#104](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/104))

## v0.1.1 (2020-10-15)

- Fixed a character-encoding bug when building from source on Windows. ([#98](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib/pull/98))

## v0.1.0 (2020-10-06)

- Initial release of cloudpathlib with support for Amazon S3 and Azure Blob Storage! 🎉
