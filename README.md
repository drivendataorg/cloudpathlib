# cloudpathlib

> Our goal is to be the meringue of file management libraries: the subtle sweetness of `pathlib` working in harmony with the ethereal lightness of the cloud.

A library that implements (nearly all) of the pathlib.Path methods for URIs for different cloud providers.

## Installation

`cloudpathlib` depends on cloud providers' SDKs (e.g., `boto3`, `azure-storage-blob`) to communicate with their respective file stores. If you try to use cloud paths for a provider for which you don't have dependencies installed, `cloudpathlib` will error and let you know what you need to install.

If you want to install a cloud provider's SDK dependency when installing `cloudpathlib`, you need to specify them for using pip's ["extras"](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#installing-setuptools-extras) specification. For example:

```bash
pip install cloudpathlib[s3,azure]
```

Currently supported providers are: `azure`, `s3`. You can also use `all` to install all available clouds' dependencies.

If you do not specify any extras or separately install any cloud SDKs, you will only be able to develop with the base classes for rolling your own cloud path class.

### Development version

You can get latest development version from GitHub:

```bash
pip install https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib.git#egg=cloudpathlib[all]
```

Note that you can similarly need to specify cloud dependencies, such as `all` in the above example command.

## Supported methods and properties

Most methods and properties from `pathlib.Path` are supported except for the ones that don't make sense in a cloud context. There are a few additional methods or properties that relate to specific cloud services or specifically for cloud paths.

Here's an example to get the gist:

```python
from cloudpathlib import S3Path

root_dir = S3Path("s3://drivendata-public-assets/")

# there's only one file, but globbing works in nested folder
for f in root_dir.glob('**/*.txt'):
    text_data = f.read_text()
    print(f)
    print(text_data)

# use / to join paths (and, in this case, create a new file)
new_file_copy = root_dir / "nested_dir/copy_file.txt"

# show things work and the file does not exist yet
print(new_file_copy)
print(new_file_copy.exists())

# writing text data to the new file in the cloud
new_file_copy.write_text(text_data)

# file now listed
print(list(root_dir.glob('**/*.txt')))

# but, we can remove it
new_file_copy.unlink()

# no longer there
print(list(root_dir.glob('**/*.txt')))

```

Results in printing the following:
